# Portfolio

This is a portfolio project that showcases my skills in web development. The project is built using Framer Motion, React, TypeScript, SASS, FontAwesome, and React Icons. It is bundled with Vite, uses PNPM for package management, and can be deployed to Vercel.

## Installation

To install the project, run the following commands:

````
pnpm install

## Usage

To start the development server, run the following command:

````
pnpm dev
````
This will start the Vite development server and open the project in your default browser.

To build the project for production, run the following command:

pnpm build
````

This will generate a production-ready build of the project that can be deployed to a web server.

## Deployment

To deploy the project to Vercel, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new account on Vercel and connect it to your GitHub repository.
2. Set up a new project on Vercel and choose the "Import Project" option.
3. Select your repository and configure the project settings.
